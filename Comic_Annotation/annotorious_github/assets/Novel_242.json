  "novel_txt": "Up to that point, my morning was no different from usual. I stood peacefully in front of the closet. When I saw the snowwhite school uniform that hung from the closet door, I found myself at a loss, however. <br><br><i>Huh?<\/i>&nbsp; Brows deeply furrowed, I stared at the uniform for a while. I rubbed my eyes. Nothing changed, so this time I tried banging my head against the wall. When I turned towards the closet again, I saw the same uniform hanging there.<br><br><i>What is this?&nbsp;<\/i>  I thought, holding the uniform. It resembled a patient's gown from some psychiatric ward the more I looked at it. The jacket was pure white, and so was the dress. The vest was a light beige, but that wasn't much of a consolation. If I put this on and buttoned my jacket, I'd be white from head to toe.<br><br>One thing I found a relief was that this was not my school's uniform. My school's uniform came in an ordinary navy color.<br><br>I stood there staring vacantly for a while before calling out to my mom.<br><br>\"Mom, where's my uniform?\"<br>\"Huh?\"<br><br>My mom, having just finished doing the dishes in the kitchen, appeared at my door. I shook the white uniform at her.<br><br>\"Mom, this isn't my school's uniform! Where's mine?\"<br>\"What are you saying, child? You went to get that fitted last week. That <i>is<\/i>&nbsp; your uniform!\"<br>\"Huh?\"<br>\"What?\"<br>"
